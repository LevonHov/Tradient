# Tradient Arbitrage System Improvements

This repository contains step-by-step guides for implementing significant improvements to the Tradient cryptocurrency arbitrage detection system.

## Overview

The following guides provide detailed implementation steps to enhance arbitrage opportunity detection speed, accuracy, and execution:

1. [Exchange Connection Improvements](docs/1-exchange-connections.md) - Implement WebSockets and optimize API usage
2. [Smart Symbol Selection](docs/2-smart-symbol-selection.md) - Create dynamic priority lists and track volatility
3. [Performance Optimizations](docs/3-performance-optimizations.md) - Improve code efficiency and hardware utilization
4. [Advanced Arbitrage Techniques](docs/4-advanced-techniques.md) - Implement triangular arbitrage and statistical patterns
5. [Architecture Improvements](docs/5-architecture-improvements.md) - Microservices and message queues
6. [Exchange Specialization](docs/6-exchange-specialization.md) - Focus on high-opportunity exchange pairs

## Implementation Sequence

We recommend implementing the improvements in the following order for maximum impact:

1. First implement WebSocket connections for major exchanges
2. Enhance symbol selection with dynamic prioritization
3. Optimize the core comparison algorithms
4. Add more exchanges with known opportunities
5. Implement the architecture improvements
6. Add advanced arbitrage techniques

## Getting Started

Begin with reviewing the [Exchange Connection Improvements](docs/1-exchange-connections.md) guide, as implementing WebSockets will give you the most immediate speed improvement.
