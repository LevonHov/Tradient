# Coding Standards and Architecture Guidelines

## 1. Architecture Principles

### 1.1 Clean Architecture
- **Domain Layer** (Core)
  - Business entities, value objects, domain services
  - No external dependencies
  - Contains business rules and logic
- **Application Layer**
  - Use cases and application services
  - Orchestrates domain objects to perform tasks
  - Implements transaction boundaries
- **Infrastructure Layer**
  - Repositories, external service adapters
  - Database interactions, API clients
  - Technical implementations of interfaces defined in inner layers
- **Presentation Layer**
  - Controllers, views, request/response models
  - User interface components
  - Input validation

### 1.2 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Bounded Contexts**
  - Clearly defined boundaries for different business domains
  - Separate contexts for risk management, trading, fee calculation
- **Ubiquitous Language**
  - Consistent terminology across code, documentation, and team communication
- **Aggregates**
  - Cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit
  - Have a root entity that controls access
- **Value Objects**
  - Immutable objects representing concepts with no identity
  - Examples: Money, Risk Score, Date Range
- **Domain Events**
  - Record significant state changes within the domain
  - Enable loose coupling between bounded contexts

## 2. SOLID Principles

### 2.1 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each class should have only one reason to change
- Separate concerns: data access, business logic, presentation
- Example: Split RiskCalculator into specialized calculators for different risk types

### 2.2 Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Use interfaces and abstract classes to allow for polymorphic behavior
- Example: Strategy pattern for different fee calculation methods

### 2.3 Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- Derived classes must not alter the behavior of base classes
- Example: All trade execution strategies must fulfill the base contract

### 2.4 Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface
- Example: Split large repository interfaces into query and command interfaces

### 2.5 Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions
- Abstractions should not depend on details
- Example: Domain layer defines repository interfaces; infrastructure implements them

## 3. Design Patterns

### 3.1 Creational Patterns
- **Factory Method/Abstract Factory**: For creating family of related objects
- **Builder**: For complex object construction
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection preferred

### 3.2 Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: For integrating with external services and APIs
- **Facade**: To provide simplified interface to complex subsystems
- **Composite**: For tree structures of components like risk calculation

### 3.3 Behavioral Patterns
- **Strategy**: For interchangeable algorithms (fee calculations, risk assessments)
- **Observer**: For event notifications and reactive components
- **Command**: For encapsulating operations as objects
- **State**: For managing object state transitions

## 4. Code Style and Conventions

### 4.1 Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: PascalCase, noun phrases (OrderProcessor, RiskCalculator)
- **Methods**: camelCase, verb phrases (calculateRisk(), processOrder())
- **Interfaces**: PascalCase with 'I' prefix or descriptive noun (IRepository or Repository)
- **Variables**: camelCase, meaningful names (orderAmount, riskScore)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (MAX_RETRY_COUNT, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT)

### 4.2 Method Guidelines
- Maximum 15-20 lines per method
- Single level of abstraction
- Clear return types and parameter names
- Method names should indicate what they do, not how

### 4.3 Class Guidelines
- Maximum 300 lines per class
- Clear separation of concerns
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Immutability where possible

## 5. Error Handling

### 5.1 Exception Hierarchy
- Custom domain exceptions extending from base ApplicationException
- Distinct exception types for different error categories
- Meaningful error messages and proper stack traces

### 5.2 Exception Handling Strategy
- Catch exceptions at boundaries where they can be properly handled
- Translate technical exceptions to domain exceptions at boundaries
- Log all exceptions with appropriate severity levels
- Never swallow exceptions without logging

## 6. Testing Standards

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- Test domain logic with isolation from external dependencies
- Use mocking frameworks for dependencies
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Test both happy paths and edge cases

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- Test interaction between components and external systems
- Use test containers for database testing
- Implement end-to-end scenarios

### 6.3 Test Coverage
- Minimum 80% code coverage for domain and application layers
- Critical paths must have 100% coverage
- Test quality over quantity

## 7. Performance and Optimization

### 7.1 Caching Strategy
- Use caching for frequently accessed, rarely changing data
- Define clear cache invalidation policies
- Consider distributed caching for horizontal scaling

### 7.2 Asynchronous Processing
- Use async/await pattern for I/O-bound operations
- Implement background processing for long-running tasks
- Consider reactive programming for event-driven components

### 7.3 Database Access
- Use efficient queries and minimize N+1 problems
- Implement pagination for large result sets
- Consider read models for complex queries

## 8. Configuration and Environment Management

### 8.1 Configuration Hierarchy
- Base configuration for defaults
- Environment-specific overrides
- Instance-specific settings
- Use YAML or similar for structured configuration

### 8.2 Secrets Management
- Never store secrets in code or configuration files
- Use secure vaults or environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate credentials regularly

## 9. Logging and Monitoring

### 9.1 Logging Guidelines
- Structured logging with consistent format
- Appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log security-relevant events

### 9.2 Monitoring
- Implement health checks for all services
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Set up alerts for critical thresholds
- Use distributed tracing for complex workflows

## 10. Security Standards

### 10.1 Input Validation
- Validate all inputs at the application boundary
- Use strong typing and constraints
- Implement defense in depth

### 10.2 Authentication and Authorization
- Implement proper authentication mechanisms
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure token handling

### 10.3 Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data retention policies
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)
